    <p class= "bodytext"> Johdi Ann Moulton is a live captioner and subtitling trainer at Ericsson Broadcasting. Her day-to-day consists of providing live and pre-recorded closed-captions for various broadcasters. 
    She also trains new employees in the skills they will need when providing captions. Responsibilities of a captioner include preparing newsroom scripts for air,
    being versed on the people and lingo that accompany a particular sport, and having clarity and speed when speaking.
    To be able to give hard of hearing viewers ease of access so they can continue enjoying their favorite programming and others who simply want the ease of following a program
    when in an environment when clear audio isn't available, is what motivates Johdi to continue providing the service that she does everyday.

    <p class= "bodytext"> Dreamer and first generation Jamaican American, she was raised in her home parish of St Catherine, before moving with her parents to the island of Nassau in the Bahamas.
     After a few years being immersed in Bahamian culture, she relocated with her family to Atlanta, Georgia which is where she now resides.
      In her freetime, she enjoys sharing pictures of her precious pups with the world through their budding Instagram account, 'CindylouandDaisytoo', traveling with her husband,
      re-reading novels, watching anime. More recently Johdi spends her downtime with her side hustle of learning how to code. She one day hopes to make a career of this new skill.</p>
